# LBTM
Multiclass-Traffic-RFID-Simulator

Simulates the operation in supermarket and hospital plant with different traffic classes. The implementation is carried out through the [Netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) modeling environment. Netlogo is multiplatform and open source.

- *hospital.nlogo* is the main simulator for the dense RFID network for the hospital scenario.
- *supermarket.nlogo* is the main simulator for the dense RFID network for the grocery shop scenario.

- *Experiments_Hospital* and Experiments_Shop. These folders contain the experiments for the RFID network scenarios investigated in the publication
